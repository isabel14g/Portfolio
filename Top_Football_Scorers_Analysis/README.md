# ⚽ Top Football Scorers Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes international football players who have scored **50 or more goals** for their national teams.  
The goal is to explore patterns in player performance, identify the most prolific scorers, evaluate scoring efficiency, and compare players across countries and time.


## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **File name:** `dataset.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains data about footballers who scored 50+ goals at international level.  
- **Sample Columns (can vary):**
  | Column Name      | Description |
  |------------------|-------------|
  | Player           | Name of the footballer |
  | Country          | National team represented |
  | Goals            | Total international goals |
  | Caps             | Games played (appearances) |
  | Goal Ratio       | Goals per match |
  | Debut Year       | Year of first international match |
  | Last Year        | Last match year (if retired) |


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool / Library | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Python         | Main programming language |
| Pandas         | Data cleaning and manipulation |
| NumPy          | Numerical computations |
| Matplotlib     | Data visualization |
| Seaborn        | Advanced visualizations |
| Jupyter Notebook | Interactive analysis |


## 🎯 Main Objectives

✔ Identify the **top goal scorers in football history**  
✔ Analyze **goal efficiency (goals per match)**  
✔ Compare **countries with the most top scorers**  
✔ Evaluate **scoring patterns over age and career timeline**  
✔ Visualize **evolution of international goals by year / player**


## 📊 Key Insights (Examples)

> ✅ *You can update these after completing the notebook*.  

- Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi lead the historical rankings.  
- Iran, Portugal, Argentina, and Malaysia have high-representation in top scorers.  
- Some players achieved high goal counts with very few matches → high efficiency (0.70+ goals per game).  
- Most goals are scored between the age of **24 and 30**, prime performance years.  
- Some countries have high scorers but lower competitive leagues → interesting contrast.

## ✅ Conclusions

- The dataset reveals **clear dominance by modern players** like Ronaldo and Messi.  
- Players from less globally dominant teams (e.g., Iran's Ali Daei) still appear at the top due to long careers and goal consistency.  
- **Goal-to-game ratio** is sometimes more meaningful than total goals. For example, players with fewer games can outperform top scorers in efficiency.  
- Most prolific scorers peak between 24–30 years old.
